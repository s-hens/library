# Library

### [Live demo](https://s-hens.github.io/library/)

## Summary

This web app lets the user keep a list of books they have read, are currently reading, or would like to read. For each book, the user can record the title, author, reading status, a rating, and personal notes. Entries can be added, modified, and deleted.

Done as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack JavaScript curriculum.
